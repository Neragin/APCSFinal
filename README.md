## What is Fulkscord

Fulkscord is a basic chatting and calling application. Users can sign up with an email, password, and a phone number. Their information is then stored inside a real time database: Firebase.

Users can then add other users as friends and have direct messages with them. Again, this implements a real time database. In addition, users can call each other through the app, which is implemented via Android's native calling features.
